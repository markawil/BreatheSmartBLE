 *
 *      CCS811 Air Quality Sensor can measure the eCO2 (equivalent CO2) and TVOC (Total Volatile Organic Compounds) density. It can be widely used
		in many applications, such as air quality detection, air purifiers, ventilation system and so on. This CCS811 air quality sensor uses AMS's unique
		micro-hot plate technology. Compared to conventional gas sensors, this sensor is lower power consumption, heating faster, and smaller.
		Internally integrated ADCs and MCUs allow data to be collected, calculated, and returned via IIC. The CCS811 supports a concentration alarm,
		which is triggered when the concentration exceeds the user-set threshold.

		The CCS811 air quality sensor supports multiple modes, such as detect in every second, in every 10s, in every one minute, in every 250ms and
		sleep mode. These modes are optimized for low power consumption during the sensor measurement, so the CCS811 is also suitable for
		portable applications.
